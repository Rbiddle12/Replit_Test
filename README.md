# Replit_Test
I can directly change and edit files in GitHub

I would have to add it, commit it, and push it

Don't directly change in main if you are with multiple people

When importing to Replit you need the file name in GitHub

Configure the run button to run certain things (python main.py works)

If you add things, it doesn't auto change on GitHub

You need to go into version control to change things

It's on the side tab, the one where the files tab is
